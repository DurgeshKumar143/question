# JavaScript Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. What are the different data types in JavaScript?
JavaScript has seven primitive data types: `undefined`, `null`, `boolean`, `number`, `bigint`, `string`, and `symbol`. The non-primitive data type is `object`.

## 2. What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var`?
- `var` has function scope and can be redeclared.
- `let` has block scope and cannot be redeclared.
- `const` has block scope and cannot be reassigned or redeclared.

## 3. Explain `hoisting` in JavaScript.
Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all variable and function declarations to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase.

## 4. What is the difference between `null` and `undefined` in JavaScript?
- `null` is an assignment value, representing no value or object.
- `undefined` is the value assigned to a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.

## 5. What are closures in JavaScript?
A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope.

## 6. How does `this` keyword work in JavaScript?
The value of `this` depends on the context in which the function is called:
- In global context, `this` refers to the global object.
- In object methods, `this` refers to the object.
- In arrow functions, `this` is lexically bound to the surrounding code.

## 7. What is the use of `bind()`, `call()`, and `apply()` in JavaScript?
- `bind()` creates a new function with a specified `this` context.
- `call()` immediately invokes a function with a specified `this` context and arguments.
- `apply()` is like `call()` but takes arguments as an array.

## 8. What are JavaScript data structures and their types?
JavaScript offers several data structures, such as:
- Arrays
- Objects
- Maps
- Sets
- WeakMap
- WeakSet

## 9. What is the event loop in JavaScript?
The event loop is a mechanism that handles asynchronous operations by placing tasks in a queue, which are processed when the call stack is empty.

## 10. Explain the concept of promises in JavaScript.
A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. It has three states: `pending`, `resolved` (fulfilled), and `rejected`.

## 11. What is async/await in JavaScript and how does it work?
`async` is used to declare a function that returns a promise. `await` is used inside `async` functions to pause execution until a promise is resolved.

## 12. What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?
- `==` compares values with type coercion.
- `===` compares both value and type without type coercion.

## 13. What are template literals in JavaScript?
Template literals are string literals that allow embedded expressions and multi-line strings. They are denoted by backticks (`` ` ``) and can include `${}` to interpolate expressions.

## 14. How do you create an object in JavaScript?
Objects can be created using object literals, constructors, or `Object.create()`.
```javascript
const obj = { key: 'value' };











# React JS Interview Questions

This repository contains more than 50 common React JS interview questions to help you prepare for your next React interview. The questions cover a wide range of topics from basic React concepts to advanced patterns and techniques.

## 1. What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications, where you can create reusable UI components.

## 2. What is JSX in React?
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It is later transpiled into React’s `createElement()` calls.

## 3. What are the different types of components in React?
React has two types of components:
- **Functional components**: Functions that return JSX.
- **Class components**: ES6 classes that extend `React.Component` and can have lifecycle methods.

## 4. What are props in React?
Props are inputs to a component. They are read-only and passed down from parent components to child components.

## 5. What is state in React?
State represents a component's data that can change over time. State is mutable and is used to update the UI based on user interaction.

## 6. What is the difference between props and state?
- **Props**: Passed to components from their parent and are read-only.
- **State**: Managed within the component and can be changed using the `setState` function.

## 7. What are React Hooks?
React Hooks are functions that let you use state and lifecycle features in functional components. Common hooks include `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.

## 8. What is the purpose of `useState` hook?
`useState` is a hook used to add state to functional components. It returns an array with the current state value and a function to update it.

## 9. What is `useEffect` in React?
`useEffect` is a hook that allows you to perform side effects in your components. It runs after the render phase and can be used for operations like fetching data or subscribing to events.

## 10. What is the virtual DOM in React?
The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React uses it to determine the minimum number of updates needed to efficiently update the real DOM.

## 11. What is the difference between a functional and class component in React?
- **Functional components** are simpler, use hooks for state management, and do not have lifecycle methods.
- **Class components** have lifecycle methods and can store local state.

## 12. What are lifecycle methods in React?
Lifecycle methods are special methods in class components that are called at specific points during a component’s lifecycle. Examples include `componentDidMount`, `componentWillUnmount`, and `shouldComponentUpdate`.

## 13. What is `componentDidMount` used for?
`componentDidMount` is a lifecycle method that runs after the component has been rendered to the screen. It is often used for data fetching or setting up subscriptions.

## 14. What is the `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method?
`componentWillUnmount` is called before a component is removed from the DOM. It is often used for cleanup tasks like clearing timers or canceling network requests.

## 15. What are controlled components?
Controlled components are form elements whose values are controlled by React state. The state is updated using `setState` and passed down as a value to the form element.

## 16. What are uncontrolled components?
Uncontrolled components are form elements that manage their own state internally. You can access their values via `refs`.

## 17. What is React Context?
React Context provides a way to share values between components without passing props down manually at every level. It is often used for themes or user authentication.

## 18. What is Redux in React?
Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications, commonly used with React. It uses a central store to manage the state of the entire application.

## 19. What are the advantages of using Redux?
Redux simplifies state management by centralizing the state in a single store, making it easier to debug and test your application.

## 20. What is the purpose of `mapStateToProps` in Redux?
`mapStateToProps` is a function used to map the state from the Redux store to the props of a component.

## 21. What is the `useReducer` hook in React?
`useReducer` is a hook that is often used as an alternative to `useState` for managing complex state logic. It works similarly to Redux reducers.

## 22. What is the purpose of `React.memo`?
`React.memo` is a higher-order component that optimizes performance by memoizing a functional component. It only re-renders if its props change.

## 23. What are fragments in React?
Fragments are a way to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. `React.Fragment` or the shorthand `<> </>` is used for this purpose.

## 24. What is the `useCallback` hook in React?
`useCallback` is a hook that returns a memoized version of a callback function, which is useful for performance optimization when passing callbacks to child components.

## 25. What is the `useMemo` hook in React?
`useMemo` is a hook that memoizes the result of a computation. It is useful for optimizing expensive calculations that don’t need to run on every render.

## 26. What is the purpose of `useRef` in React?
`useRef` is a hook that returns a mutable object, which can store a reference to a DOM element or a value that persists across re-renders.

## 27. What is prop drilling?
Prop drilling occurs when you pass data from a parent component to deeply nested child components through props.

## 28. What is React Router?
React Router is a library used for implementing routing in React applications, enabling navigation between different views or pages.

## 29. What is `React.lazy()`?
`React.lazy()` allows you to dynamically import a component only when it is needed, supporting code splitting and reducing the initial bundle size.

## 30. What is `Suspense` in React?
`Suspense` is a component that allows you to suspend rendering while waiting for some asynchronous operation (like data fetching) to complete. It’s typically used with `React.lazy()`.

## 31. What is the purpose of `shouldComponentUpdate`?
`shouldComponentUpdate` is a lifecycle method that allows you to prevent unnecessary re-renders by returning `false` when the component’s state or props have not changed.

## 32. What are higher-order components (HOCs)?
A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props or functionality.

## 33. What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in React?
Server-side rendering refers to rendering a React application on the server and sending the fully rendered HTML to the client, improving initial load times and SEO.

## 34. What are Pure Components in React?
Pure components are class components that implement `shouldComponentUpdate` with a shallow prop and state comparison, leading to performance optimizations.

## 35. What is the `key` prop in React?
The `key` prop is used to uniquely identify elements in a list so React can efficiently re-render only the items that changed.

## 36. What is the purpose of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in React?
`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is a prop used to set HTML content directly from a string, similar to the `innerHTML` property in the DOM. It should be used with caution to avoid XSS attacks.

## 37. What is React DevTools?
React DevTools is a browser extension that helps you inspect and debug React components, their state, and props.

## 38. What is code splitting in React?
Code splitting is the practice of dividing your JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks that are loaded as needed, reducing initial load time.

## 39. What is the `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method?
`componentDidUpdate` is called after a component has updated due to changes in state or props. It is useful for performing side effects after the update.

## 40. What are controlled and uncontrolled inputs in React?
- **Controlled inputs**: Form elements whose value is controlled by the state of the component.
- **Uncontrolled inputs**: Form elements that maintain their own internal state, accessed via refs.

## 41. What is event delegation in React?
Event delegation is a technique where an event listener is attached to a parent element instead of individual child elements, improving performance.

## 42. What is the `new` keyword in React?
In React, the `new` keyword is not used directly in components. However, it is used in the `new React.Component()` class-based component structure.

## 43. What is the `React.Fragment` shorthand syntax?
The shorthand for `React.Fragment` is `<> </>`, which helps group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

## 44. What is Webpack, and how does it work with React?
Webpack is a module bundler that compiles JavaScript, CSS, and other files into a single or multiple bundled files. It’s commonly used in React applications for bundling code, handling static assets, and supporting code splitting.

## 45. What is the difference between `ReactDOM.render()` and `ReactDOM.hydrate()`?
- `ReactDOM.render()` is used for client-side rendering of React components.
- `ReactDOM.hydrate()` is used to rehydrate server-rendered content, ensuring that React can take control of the existing HTML.

## 46. What is the `useContext` hook in React?
`useContext` is a hook that allows functional components to subscribe to the nearest value of a context.

## 47. What is the `useLayoutEffect` hook in React?
`useLayoutEffect` is similar to `useEffect`, but it is called synchronously after all DOM mutations, allowing you to measure DOM elements before they are painted.

## 48. What are the limitations of React?
- React can be complex for small projects.
- It has a steep learning curve for beginners.
- React may require additional libraries (like Redux) for state management in large apps.

## 49. What are Error Boundaries in React?
Error boundaries are components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the whole app.

## 50. How does React handle forms?
React forms are usually controlled components where the form input values are stored in the component’s state and updated using `setState`.

## 51. What is the purpose of the `useEffect` dependency array?
The dependency array in `useEffect` tells React when to re-run the effect. If the dependencies haven't changed, the effect will not run again.







# Core C# Interview Questions

This repository contains a list of core C# interview questions. These questions cover fundamental concepts, object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, LINQ, async programming, and more.

## 1. What is C#?
C# is a statically typed, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft as part of the .NET framework. It is used for developing a wide range of applications, from desktop to web and mobile applications.

## 2. What are the main features of C#?
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Type safety
- Garbage collection
- Rich class libraries
- LINQ (Language Integrated Query)
- Asynchronous programming
- Cross-platform compatibility with .NET Core

## 3. What is the difference between `==` and `Equals()` in C#?
- `==` checks for reference equality for reference types and value equality for value types.
- `Equals()` is a method that checks the equality of two objects based on their content. It can be overridden to compare the state of objects.

## 4. What is a class and an object in C#?
- A **class** is a blueprint or template that defines the properties, methods, and behaviors of an object.
- An **object** is an instance of a class, created using the `new` keyword.

## 5. What is the difference between `struct` and `class` in C#?
- **Class**: Reference type, stored on the heap, supports inheritance and polymorphism.
- **Struct**: Value type, stored on the stack, more memory-efficient, but does not support inheritance (except for implementing interfaces).

## 6. What is inheritance in C#?
Inheritance is an OOP principle where a class can inherit fields, methods, and properties from another class. The derived class can extend or override the functionality of the base class.

## 7. What is polymorphism in C#?
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

## 8. What is encapsulation in C#?
Encapsulation is the practice of keeping fields and methods private and only exposing them through public properties or methods. It protects object integrity by preventing outside interference.

## 9. What is the difference between `abstract class` and `interface` in C#?
- **Abstract class**: Can have both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation). A class can inherit only one abstract class.
- **Interface**: Defines a contract for classes to implement. Interfaces can have only method signatures and properties (no implementation). A class can implement multiple interfaces.

## 10. What is the use of the `virtual` keyword in C#?
The `virtual` keyword is used to define a method or property in a base class that can be overridden by derived classes.

## 11. What is `override` and `new` keyword in C#?
- `override` is used to modify the behavior of a base class method in a derived class.
- `new` hides a base class member and provides a new implementation, but it does not replace the base class method when accessed through a reference to the base class.

## 12. What is the `sealed` keyword in C#?
The `sealed` keyword prevents a class from being inherited. When applied to a method, it prevents the method from being overridden in derived classes.

## 13. What is a delegate in C#?
A delegate is a type-safe function pointer that can reference a method with a specific parameter list and return type. It is used to define callback methods and event handlers.

## 14. What is an event in C#?
An event is a mechanism in C# that allows a class or object to notify other classes or objects when something of interest occurs, typically through delegates.

## 15. What are generics in C#?
Generics allow you to define classes, methods, or interfaces with placeholder types, making the code more reusable and type-safe.

## 16. What is LINQ (Language Integrated Query)?
LINQ is a feature in C# that allows you to query collections (arrays, lists, databases, etc.) in a declarative way using SQL-like syntax directly in C#.

## 17. What is the difference between `String` and `StringBuilder` in C#?
- `String` is immutable. Every time a modification is made, a new instance is created.
- `StringBuilder` is mutable. It is more efficient when performing many string manipulations because it does not create new instances on each modification.

## 18. What is a `foreach` loop in C#?
The `foreach` loop is used to iterate over a collection (such as arrays, lists, or other collections) without the need to manage the index or collection size.

## 19. What is the `using` keyword in C#?
The `using` keyword is used to import namespaces, define an alias for a namespace, or to create a scope in which objects that implement `IDisposable` are automatically disposed.

## 20. What is the `try-catch` block in C#?
The `try-catch` block is used for exception handling. Code that might throw an exception is placed in the `try` block, and the `catch` block handles the exception if one occurs.

## 21. What is a `static` class in C#?
A `static` class is a class that cannot be instantiated and can only contain static members. It is often used for utility or helper classes.

## 22. What is the `async` and `await` keywords in C#?
- `async` is used to declare a method as asynchronous.
- `await` is used to pause the execution of an async method until the awaited task completes.

## 23. What is a task in C#?
A `Task` represents an asynchronous operation and is part of the `System.Threading.Tasks` namespace. It allows for parallel programming and handling asynchronous methods.

## 24. What is the `lock` keyword in C#?
The `lock` keyword is used to ensure that a block of code is accessed by only one thread at a time, helping prevent race conditions in multithreaded environments.

## 25. What is the difference between `==` and `Object.ReferenceEquals()`?
- `==` compares values or references, depending on the type (for reference types, it checks reference equality).
- `Object.ReferenceEquals()` compares references of two objects to determine if they are the same object in memory.

## 26. What is the purpose of `GC.Collect()` in C#?
`GC.Collect()` forces the garbage collector to run and reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use.

## 27. What is reflection in C#?
Reflection is the ability to inspect and interact with the metadata of types at runtime, allowing you to dynamically create objects, invoke methods, and access properties.

## 28. What is dependency injection in C#?
Dependency injection is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC). It allows a class to receive its dependencies (objects it requires) from an external source rather than creating them internally.

## 29. What is a `Nullable` type in C#?
A `Nullable` type allows value types (like `int`, `bool`, etc.) to be assigned a null value. It is defined using `?` after the type, for example, `int?`.

## 30. What is the `default` keyword in C#?
The `default` keyword returns the default value for a type. For value types, it returns the zero-initialized value (e.g., `0` for `int`, `false` for `bool`), and for reference types, it returns `null`.

## 31. What is an indexer in C#?
An indexer allows an object to be indexed like an array, enabling objects to define the behavior of array-like access to their internal data.

## 32. What is `Tuple` in C#?
A `Tuple` is a data structure that can hold a fixed-size collection of items, potentially of different types. It is often used for returning multiple values from a method.

## 33. What is the difference between `ref` and `out` parameters in C#?
- `ref`: The parameter must be initialized before it is passed to the method.
- `out`: The parameter does not need to be initialized before being passed, but it must be assigned a value before the method returns.

## 34. What is a `using` statement in C#?
The `using` statement is used to automatically dispose of objects that implement the `IDisposable` interface when they are no longer needed.

## 35. What is the `yield` keyword in C#?
The `yield` keyword is used in an iterator method to return each element of a collection one by one. It is used to create custom iterator blocks.






# OOP Concepts Interview Questions

This repository contains a list of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) interview questions. These questions cover the key principles of OOP, including encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and more.

## 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of "objects," which are instances of classes. These objects have attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods). OOP helps in organizing code in a modular and reusable way, and it encourages data encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## 2. What are the four main principles of OOP?
The four main principles of OOP are:
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling the data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It also involves restricting access to some of an object's components and protecting it from outside interference.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary functionality to the user. It helps in reducing complexity by providing a clear interface.
- **Inheritance**: A mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behavior (methods) from an existing class. This allows for code reusability and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.
- **Polymorphism**: The ability to process objects of different types through a common interface. It allows methods to be implemented in multiple forms, either by method overloading (same method name, different parameters) or method overriding (same method signature, different implementations).

## 3. What is a class in OOP?
A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties and behaviors of an object. It is a user-defined data type that contains fields (attributes) and methods (functions). A class can be used to create multiple instances, or objects, of the class.

## 4. What is an object in OOP?
An object is an instance of a class. It has state (attributes) and behavior (methods). An object is created from a class and represents an entity in the real world.

## 5. What is encapsulation in OOP?
Encapsulation is the practice of keeping fields (attributes) of a class private and providing public methods to access or modify those fields. This helps in controlling access to the data and preventing unauthorized manipulation.

## 6. What is abstraction in OOP?
Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary functionality. It allows the user to interact with a system using a simple interface, without needing to understand the underlying complexities.

## 7. What is inheritance in OOP?
Inheritance allows one class (subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

## 8. What is polymorphism in OOP?
Polymorphism refers to the ability of different classes to respond to the same method or message in their own way. It is achieved either through:
- **Method Overloading**: Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class.
- **Method Overriding**: A method in a derived class that has the same signature as a method in the base class but provides its own implementation.

## 9. What is method overloading in OOP?
Method overloading occurs when two or more methods in the same class share the same name but have different parameters (either in number, type, or both). The method that gets called depends on the argument passed.

## 10. What is method overriding in OOP?
Method overriding occurs when a derived class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class. The method in the base class must be marked as `virtual`, and the method in the derived class must use the `override` keyword.

## 11. What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?
- **Method Overloading**: Same method name with different parameters in the same class.
- **Method Overriding**: A method in a subclass with the same signature as a method in the superclass, with a new implementation.

## 12. What is the difference between a class and an object?
- **Class**: A blueprint or template that defines the structure and behaviors of an object.
- **Object**: An instance of a class that represents a real-world entity with attributes and behaviors.

## 13. What is a constructor in OOP?
A constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically invoked when an object of that class is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes and set default values. Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type.

## 14. What is a destructor in OOP?
A destructor is a special method that is called when an object is destroyed or goes out of scope. It is used to clean up resources that the object may have acquired during its lifetime (e.g., closing file handles or releasing memory). In C#, destructors are called finalizers.

## 15. What is an interface in OOP?
An interface is a contract that defines a set of methods or properties that a class must implement. It does not contain any implementation, just the method signatures. Classes can implement multiple interfaces, but they can inherit from only one class.

## 16. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?
- **Abstract Class**: Can contain both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation). A class can inherit from only one abstract class.
- **Interface**: Only contains method signatures (without implementation). A class can implement multiple interfaces.

## 17. What is a `virtual` method in OOP?
A `virtual` method is a method in a base class that can be overridden in a derived class. The `virtual` keyword allows a method to have a default implementation that can be replaced by a derived class's own implementation.

## 18. What is an abstract class?
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and can contain both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation). It is meant to be inherited by other classes, providing a common interface and some shared functionality.

## 19. What is a `sealed` class in OOP?
A `sealed` class is a class that cannot be inherited. When a class is sealed, it prevents other classes from deriving from it, thus ensuring that no further subclassing occurs.

## 20. What is a `static` class in OOP?
A `static` class is a class that cannot be instantiated and can only contain static members. Static classes are often used for utility methods or functions that do not require instance-specific data.

## 21. What is the difference between a static method and an instance method?
- **Static Method**: Belongs to the class rather than an instance. It can be called using the class name and does not require an object instance.
- **Instance Method**: Belongs to an instance of the class and requires an object instance to be invoked.

## 22. What is composition in OOP?
Composition is a design principle where one class is made up of one or more objects from other classes. It allows for a "has-a" relationship. Composition is often preferred over inheritance when building flexible systems.

## 23. What is aggregation in OOP?
Aggregation is a special form of association that represents a "whole-part" relationship between classes. In aggregation, the child object can exist independently of the parent object.

## 24. What is the difference between composition and aggregation?
- **Composition**: A strong relationship between objects where the child cannot exist without the parent.
- **Aggregation**: A weaker relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent.

## 25. What is the significance of the `this` keyword in OOP?
The `this` keyword refers to the current instance of the class. It is used to differentiate between instance variables and method parameters when they have the same name and can also be used to invoke other methods or constructors in the class.



# ADO.NET Interview Questions

## 1. What is ADO.NET?
ADO.NET (Active Data Objects .NET) is a set of classes in the .NET Framework that provides access to data sources like SQL Server, Oracle, and other databases. It allows for querying, updating, and manipulating data in a disconnected manner using DataSets, DataTables, and DataAdapters.

## 2. What is the difference between connected and disconnected architecture in ADO.NET?
- **Connected Architecture**: In this architecture, the connection to the data source is maintained throughout the operation. Data is retrieved and updated using objects like `SqlConnection`, `SqlCommand`, and `SqlDataReader`.
- **Disconnected Architecture**: In this architecture, data is retrieved and stored in memory (using `DataSet`, `DataTable`, etc.), and the connection to the data source is closed after the data is fetched. Operations can then be performed on the data without the need for a constant database connection.

## 3. What are the main objects in ADO.NET?
- **Connection (`SqlConnection`)**: Represents a connection to the data source.
- **Command (`SqlCommand`)**: Executes SQL queries or stored procedures.
- **DataReader (`SqlDataReader`)**: Retrieves data from the data source in a forward-only, read-only manner.
- **DataAdapter (`SqlDataAdapter`)**: Populates `DataSet` or `DataTable` objects with data from the database and updates the database.
- **DataSet**: A disconnected collection of data tables and their relationships.
- **DataTable**: A representation of a single table of data.
- **Transaction (`SqlTransaction`)**: Ensures that a group of operations are completed successfully or rolled back in case of errors.

## 4. What is a `DataSet` in ADO.NET?
A `DataSet` is an in-memory representation of data that can hold multiple `DataTable` objects. It is used in disconnected scenarios and can hold data from multiple tables and their relationships. It is also capable of handling data from multiple sources and performing operations like filtering, sorting, and updating.

## 5. What is a `DataTable` in ADO.NET?
A `DataTable` is a single table of in-memory data that holds rows and columns. It is part of the `DataSet` and can be used independently for operations like sorting, filtering, and updating data.

## 6. What is the difference between `SqlCommand` and `SqlDataAdapter`?
- **`SqlCommand`**: Executes SQL commands such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` directly against the database and is used in connected architecture.
- **`SqlDataAdapter`**: Acts as a bridge between the database and the `DataSet`. It retrieves data from the database and fills the `DataSet` or `DataTable`. It also updates the database with changes made to the `DataSet`.

## 7. What is `SqlDataReader` in ADO.NET?
`SqlDataReader` is used to read data from a database in a forward-only, read-only manner. It provides an efficient way of reading data from a data source as it does not load all data into memory at once.

## 8. What is a `SqlConnection` object used for?
A `SqlConnection` object is used to establish a connection between your application and the database. It is responsible for opening, closing, and managing the connection to the SQL Server database.

## 9. How do you handle exceptions in ADO.NET?
Exceptions in ADO.NET are handled using the `try-catch` block. For example:
```csharp
try
{
    SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connectionString);
    conn.Open();
    SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM Users", conn);
    SqlDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader();
}
catch (SqlException ex)
{
    // Handle the exception
    Console.WriteLine("Error: " + ex.Message);
}
finally
{
    // Close the connection in the finally block
    conn.Close();
}


10. What is a Transaction in ADO.NET?
A Transaction is used to ensure that a series of database operations are treated as a single unit of work. If any operation in the transaction fails, all previous operations are rolled back to maintain data consistency.

11. What is the use of DataAdapter in ADO.NET?
A DataAdapter is used to fill a DataSet or DataTable with data from the database and to update the database with changes made in the DataSet or DataTable. It works in the disconnected mode by automatically managing the database connection for reading and writing operations.

12. What is the difference between ExecuteReader, ExecuteScalar, and ExecuteNonQuery in ADO.NET?
ExecuteReader: Used to execute a query that returns multiple rows (e.g., SELECT statement) and returns a SqlDataReader object for reading the data.
ExecuteScalar: Used to execute a query that returns a single value (e.g., an aggregate function like COUNT or SUM).
ExecuteNonQuery: Used to execute a query that does not return any data (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), and it returns the number of affected rows.
13. How do you update a database using DataSet in ADO.NET?
To update a database using a DataSet, you can use a DataAdapter object with its Update method. This method sends the changes made in the DataSet to the database:

csharp
Copy code
SqlDataAdapter adapter = new SqlDataAdapter("SELECT * FROM Users", connection);
SqlCommandBuilder builder = new SqlCommandBuilder(adapter);
DataSet ds = new DataSet();
adapter.Fill(ds, "Users");

// Make changes to the dataset
ds.Tables["Users"].Rows[0]["Name"] = "Updated Name";

// Update the database with the changes
adapter.Update(ds, "Users");
14. What is CommandBuilder in ADO.NET?
A CommandBuilder automatically generates SQL commands (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) for a DataAdapter based on the SELECT statement. It is useful when you want to perform operations like updating or deleting rows in the database directly from a DataSet.

15. How do you connect to a SQL Server database using ADO.NET?
To connect to a SQL Server database, you can use the SqlConnection class. Example:

csharp
Copy code
string connectionString = "Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;User Id=myUsername;Password=myPassword;";
SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connectionString);
conn.Open();
16. What is ExecuteScalar used for in ADO.NET?
ExecuteScalar is used to execute a query that returns a single value, such as an aggregate function (COUNT(), SUM(), etc.). It returns the first column of the first row in the result set, ignoring other columns and rows.

17. How do you perform paging in ADO.NET?
Paging can be achieved by using SQL queries with LIMIT (for MySQL) or OFFSET and FETCH (for SQL Server). Example for SQL Server:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM Users
ORDER BY UserID
OFFSET 0 ROWS
FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY;
You can use the SqlCommand object to execute these queries and retrieve the paged data.

18. What is connection pooling in ADO.NET?
Connection pooling is a technique used to reduce the overhead of opening and closing database connections repeatedly. Instead of opening a new connection every time, a pool of reusable connections is maintained, improving the application's performance and scalability.

19. What are the advantages of using DataSet over DataReader?
DataSet: Works in a disconnected manner and can hold multiple tables with their relationships, making it suitable for complex data operations.
DataReader: Works in a connected manner and provides faster, forward-only, read-only data access.
20. What is the role of the SqlParameter in ADO.NET?
SqlParameter is used to represent parameters in SQL queries or stored procedures. It helps prevent SQL injection attacks by allowing parameters to be passed to queries securely.
